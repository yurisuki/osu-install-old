# introduction
Install osu! on Linux by executing one script and pressing ENTER! It just takes shy of ~4 minutes on my machine (Could take less on yours) to have fully functioning osu!.

Yes, exactly, that's what this script does do! No more need to hassle with the difficult and time-consuming installation.

# how do I execute this script?
It's really easy!
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yurisuki/osu-install/master/osu-install | bash
```
That's it!

# todo/goals
- ~~Make installation script for other distros than Arch Linux~~

# faq
But why tho?
- It takes really long time to install osu! on Linux manually and it's tiring. That's why I made this.

# huge thanks to ThePooN!
He made the low-latency on PulseAudio possible, thank you for that. He did all the work, and I just stole it.
